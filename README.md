# Introduction

In this statistical analysis project, we will work on a diamond dataset that contains diamond price, table, depth, x-y-z dimensions, color, clarity, cut quality, and carat. 

We will first perform descriptive analysis on some of the features by calculating its central tendency and dispersion. Then we will perform regression on diamond price using multiple techniques and approaches and compare their performance, We will use linear regression to predict the diamond's price And Finally, we will attempt to classify the clarity of the diamond based on its other features.

the dataset used can be found here:
